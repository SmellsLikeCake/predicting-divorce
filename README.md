This project explores whether it is possible to predict whether someone is divorced based on their demographic traits.

The data for this project came from the [General Social Survey 2012](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/35478).

The results of the project are written up in the pdf document [https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/predicting-divorce/blob/master/Predicting-Divorce.pdf ](https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/predicting-divorce/blob/master/Predicting-Divorce.pdf)

The jupyter notebook containing the python code used in the final version of the project is [https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/predicting-divorce/blob/master/Predicting-Divorce-remove-singles.ipynb](https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/predicting-divorce/blob/master/Predicting-Divorce-remove-singles.ipynb).
